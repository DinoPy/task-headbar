# Task yourself

#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>

#### Description:

### Short: For those unable to organize themselves that also hate having to check different tools for being reminded of tasks left to do.

### Large:

-- Built with electron so the app is used on cross platform desktops --

### Features:

- Komodoro timer (without the large break).
  When the timer expires there are notifications that pop up + sounds that play (only when not built).
- List of toggable tasks (to set which you are actively working on), the tasks is toggled via left click and is completed via scroll button click. Each task has a: title, description, category (editable via right click -> edit); A timer that only counts when the komodoro timer isn't on break or paused.
- CSV export of completed tasks. The list is generated when the app is closed.

Note: The app only works on sessions = it saves nothing to memory so it can be used on a different instance.

While the app seems simple it required a lot of research, understanding of features, design that would work fine across platforms, and is been remade 2 times.
